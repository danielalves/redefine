/**
 *  Represents a runtime method redefinition of a class or instance method. It also makes possible to switch back and forth
 *  through implementations, the original and the new one. ALDRedefinition uses the C++ concept of RAII, so the user just have
 *  to make sure to mantain a reference to the redefinition object for it to take place. When it is deallocated, everything
 *  goes back to normal.
 *
 *  <B> Since version 1.0.2 </B>
 *
 *  Setting a redefinition in place stops a previous redefition of the same target. Hence, it it possible to create multiple
 *  redefinitions of the same class/instance selector and use them at will. The property usingRedefinition has become KVO
 *  compliant, so it is possible to listen to these changes.
 *
 *  Starting and stoping to use a redefinition are synchronized operations, what makes ALDRedefinition thread safe.
